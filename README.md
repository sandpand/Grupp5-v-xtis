# Automatic Plant Watering System

This project is an Arduino-based automatic plant watering system with light and UV control. It uses sensors to monitor soil moisture and light levels and automatically waters the plant and provides UV light when needed.

## Features

* Automatic watering based on soil moisture.
* Automatic UV light control based on ambient light levels.
* LED indicator for watering status.
* LCD display for sensor readings.

## Components

* Arduino Uno
* Soil Moisture Sensor
* Light Sensor (LDR)
* UV LED
* Water Pump (5V)
* Resistors
* LED
* Connecting Wires
* Breadboard
* LCD Display
* (Optional) RTC Module

## Getting Started

1.  Connect the components according to the schematic.
2.  Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino Uno.
3.  Place the soil moisture sensor in the plant's soil.
4.  Fill the water container and connect the pump.
5.  Power on the system.

## Usage

The system will automatically monitor soil moisture and light levels and activate the water pump and UV LED as needed. The LED indicator will show the status of the water pump.
